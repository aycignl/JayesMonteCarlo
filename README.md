#Bayes MonteCarlo-java

>In this repository, **sampling.java** class seperates two main parts.  The first part is Bayesian Network part, and the second one is Monte Carlo sampling part.   

#####I want to create a Bayesian Network.
>I worked with five nodes.  Four of them have priors, and the last one has posterior(**bayesianNetwork.java**).  We can determine exact probabilities or assign randomly.  
**For creating Bayesian Network, I used Jayes package which is written by Michael Kutschke.**
